This is my first "bigger" project I uploaded on github for application purposes. 
I summerized some little programs in a menu with explanation, so the user can navigate back an force through the different programs.

You just need to compile the file 20_Mechanic256Projects/src/mechanicprojects/Mechanic256.java - It contains the main().
