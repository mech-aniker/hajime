This is my first "bigger" project I uploaded on github for application purposes. 

I summerized some little programs in a menu with explanations
so the user can navigate back an force through the different programs 
and is ably to get an idea of my modest coding skills;)

You just need to compile the file 20_Mechanic256Projects/src/mechanicprojects/Mechanic256.java - It contains the main().

Enjoy!
